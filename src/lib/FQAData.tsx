    question: "What is Linux Games Alt?",
    answer:
      "It’s a platform built for the Linux community. We don't just tell you a game is broken; we show you the **best high-performance alternatives** so you never have to reboot into Windows.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you determine compatibility?",
    answer:
      "We cross-reference the [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) and [Are we Anti-Cheat Yet?](https://areweanticheatyet.com/) databases and community reports. If a popular title is **'Borked'** or **'Unsupported'** due to anti-cheat or engine issues, we flag it and find a similar game that runs flawlessly on Linux.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you actually test these games?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We don't like 'theoretical' gaming. We verify that our recommendations actually run so you don't waste time (or bandwidth) on a title that won't launch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why Do I use this website instead of just checking ProtonDB?",
    answer:
      "ProtonDB is a great diagnostic tool, but it's often a dead end. When you see a **'Silver'** or **'Borked'** rating, you're stuck. We provide the **'What's next?'** by suggesting similar games that respect your choice of OS.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about non-Steam games like League or Valorant?",
    answer:
      "That’s our specialty. We track the **'Anti-Cheat Wall'** for launchers like Riot, Epic, and Ubisoft. Since these companies often overlook the Linux user base, we maintain custom data to find you alternatives that actually want you as a player.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this site safe to use?",
    answer:
      "Totally. No trackers, no sign-ins, and zero data harvesting. This website is **completely open-source**, so you can audit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eyadkhfarah/linux-games-alt/) yourself to see exactly what's under the hood. I mean bro, look around—there isn’t even a 'Login' button. We’re just here to help you play, and that’s it.",
